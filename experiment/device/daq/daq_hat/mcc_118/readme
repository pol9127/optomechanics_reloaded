The MCC118 is a data acquisition addition to the raspberry pi. The drivers and C-API and Python-API can be found on
github (https://github.com/mccdaq/daqhats).
Follow the instructions there to install their package.

The files provided here transform the raspberry pi into a data server which can be operated and queried from a client.

To obtain this run the daq_server as a service on the raspberry pi and connect with it via the client script.

Instruction on how to setup the daq_server service on the raspberry pi:

1) sudo nano /lib/systemd/system/daq-server.service

use the content from the daq-server.service in the current directory. Depending on where your python script is located
on the raspberry pi you might have to adjust the script accordingly.

2) Modify permissions and enable service

sudo chmod 644 /lib/systemd/system/daq-server.service
chmod +x /home/pi/Documents/daq_server.py
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable daq-server.service
sudo systemctl start daq-server.service

[3) Modify service-file. Every time after modification execute:
sudo systemctl daemon-reload]
